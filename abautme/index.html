    <h3>Jhova</h3>
    <p>Hello, let me introduce myself. My name is Geovanny, I am from Ecuador, I am in this course because I love technology, I want to learn to create my own web pages.
    <p>I have different hobbies like reading books, table games, and playing the violin. I use the weekends for reading, currently, I am reading the book "The power of habits", and rarely do we play table games with my family and friends. I learned to play the violin when I was 17 years old. I knew the Gospel for playing the violin, the leaders invited me to play the violin in the conference of the ward. Later I was baptized.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Currently,  I am married, we have a baby his name is Amir, and he is the joy of our home. I am a member of the Church for 12 years, I like the scripture that is in 1 Nephi chapter 8, about the dream of Lehi.</p>
